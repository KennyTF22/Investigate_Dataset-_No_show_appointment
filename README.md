# Python - Exploring the No show appointment Dataset

In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.


## Dataset

This dataset collects information
from 100k medical appointments in
Brazil and is focused on the question
of whether or not patients show up
for their appointment. A number of
characteristics about the patient are
included in each row.
## Key Questions and Summary Findings

#### Key Questions:
     
- What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
- What is the percentage of the patients that have been diagnosed with each if thes ailments?
- What is the percentage of the patients that received SMS or have scholarship?


#### Summary Findings:

- A patient having a scholarship or not does not significantly determine whether the scholarship would show up for his/her appointment or not, it would be expected that patients would scholarship would take advantage and show up more, but from the dataset, that doesn't seem to be the case

- To improve patient show up rate, the clinic should see to it that the patients get an SMS notification of when they are supposed to have their appointment, this helps to register that appointmemt date in the minds of the patients, provided the read the SMS though.
